 * This is the producer of redis jobs, ie where long-running tasks to generate thumbnails

 * pub/sub infrastructure used by redis and Bull.
 *
 * This function is currently only called in 'api/images' after an image has been uploaded.
 * When this happens, we first create an instance of our custom Job model to represent this
 * long-running task. We then create the actual redis job by putting this job into our Bull queue.
 * When this job reached the front of the queue, it is processed in './consumer.js'.
